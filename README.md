# Another Markdown LSP

A project primarily to learn how an LSP works â€” and because I like both
Marksman and zk-nvim, but I can't use them at the same time.

### Features

Currently, this server supports:

- **Wiki-links preview**  
  Example:
  ```md
  Example: [[example_link]]  
  To a Header: [[example_link#With Header]]
  ```
